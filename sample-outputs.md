# Appendix C: MAGIC Outputs

## Table C1: MAGIC vs. Baseline Feedback Example

### MAGIC Feedback

The essay effectively challenges the argument's reasoning, identifying the flaw of equating correlation with causation. As noted by the expert graders, the essay successfully points out that the absence of protective gear doesn't necessarily mean it would have prevented injury. The discussion of alternative factors—training, health, common sense—is valuable, though it could be expanded upon as suggested by the expert graders.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

**Strengths:**
- **Clear Identification of Flaw:** The essay immediately recognizes the logical fallacy in assuming that lack of gear leads to injury.
- **Alternative Factors:** Bringing up training, health, and common sense demonstrates a good understanding of the complexity of the situation.
- **Grammar and Mechanics:** The writing is mostly clear and grammatically sound, as highlighted by the final expert grader.

**Areas for Improvement (building on expert feedback):**
- **Expand on Alternatives:** Don't just mention training, health, and common sense; explain how they mitigate risks. Provide concrete examples. What specific skills learned in training reduce injury likelihood? How does physical fitness play a role?
- **Specificity Regarding Injuries:** Differentiate between minor and severe injuries. The original argument implies a link between lack of gear and serious harm. Focus your critique on that specific connection.
- **Stronger Conclusion:** The current conclusion ("statistics…must be further examined") is weak. Reiterate your main point—that the argument oversimplifies the issue and relies on faulty assumptions. Offer a more definitive statement about the limitations of the statistics.
- **Refine Sentence Structure:** While the grammar is generally correct, some sentences are overly long and convoluted. Breaking them down into shorter, clearer units would improve readability.

### Baseline Feedback

This is a well-reasoned critique of the argument presented. The essay effectively identifies the vagueness of the statistics and points out that correlation doesn't equal causation. The discussion about various potential injuries, both preventable and unpreventable, strengthens the argument against the simplistic conclusion drawn by the original author.

However, while the essay raises valid concerns, it could benefit from slightly more precise language and a stronger concluding statement that directly summarizes the flaws in the initial argument. For example, explicitly stating that the argument commits a fallacy of hasty generalization would elevate the analysis.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong understanding of critical thinking and argumentation.
